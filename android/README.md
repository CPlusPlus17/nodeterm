# nodeterm for Android

The Android companion to nodeterm: pair your phone with nodeterm on your computer, then watch your
agents, answer their questions and open any terminal on the canvas — on your network over SSH, or
from anywhere through the end-to-end encrypted relay. It is the Android counterpart of the iOS app
and speaks the same protocol to the same desktop; nothing on the computer needs to know which phone
it is talking to.

> **Status (2026-09-26): not ready for users.** CI builds the debug APK, and the release blockers
> and medium bugs an audit found are fixed on this branch and tested where the code allows — but the
> app has **not yet been run on a phone**. The plan and what is still open are in
> [`docs/android-handover.md`](../docs/android-handover.md); the findings are in
> [`docs/android-audit-2026-09.md`](../docs/android-audit-2026-09.md).

## What it does

The APK is built by CI, but **no row below has been checked on a device yet**: ✓ means the code is
written for it and tested where the layer allows, and the numbered
[device checklist](../docs/android.md#device-checklist) is what will check it.

| | Android | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pair by QR (or pasted code, or a `nodeterm://pair` link) | ✓ | E2EE-sealed `/pair`, Ed25519 key made on the phone |
| Direct connection on your network (SSH + tmux) | ✓ | TOFU-pinned host key; the desktop's own tmux socket |
| From anywhere (relay, E2EE, SAS approval) | ✓ | A current desktop approves the phone at the scan (its relay key rides the sealed `/pair` body); an older one shows a code on the first relay connect |
| Late relay adoption (paired while remote access was off) | ✓ | Reads `~/.nodeterm/relay.json` over SSH, mints its own device token |
| Sessions, grouped like the desktop sidebar | ✓ | Needs you / Running / Sleeping, activity + context % |
| Terminal (co-attach to the live tmux session) | ✓ | xterm.js renderer, native input bar, special keys, swipe = tmux scroll. Tap a link (also one wrapped over several rows, or an OSC 8 link): the phone names its host and opens it only when you confirm, and only an http(s) one. The Copy chip opens a sheet of the screen's lines and links to select and copy or share. A copy the pane sends itself (OSC 52, e.g. vim's `"+y`) reaches the clipboard too, but tmux's copy-mode is out of easy reach on a touch screen |
| Sleeping (Eco) session opened | ✓ | Through the relay the computer wakes it on open. Over SSH the phone offers the desktop's wake line (`--resume <id>`, + permission mode for Claude only), while a shell owns the pane, typed only on a tap |
| Cold-start resume offer (the computer rebooted) | relay | Offers the agent's own `--resume <id>`; never types it unasked. Over SSH a session that is not running is never created (it would lack its hook environment): the phone offers to open it through the relay |
| Sessions of the computer's SSH projects | relay | They run on another host; the computer attaches them over its SSH connection. Over direct SSH the phone offers the relay instead |
| New session (agent / shell) → registered on the canvas | relay | `projects.registerNode`, launched before registration so the desktop never double-launches. On your network the phone opens the relay leg next to SSH for it; with no relay leg (remote access off) the button is disabled and says why |
| Wake / refresh / rename / end session | relay (end: both) | `node.*` verbs, through the relay leg next to SSH when on your network; over SSH "end" stops the tmux session only |
| Kanban board, move cards, labels | relay (reads: both) | `projects.ensureBoard/setCardColumn/editCardLabels`; on your network the writes go through the relay leg next to SSH, and are disabled with the reason when there is none |
| Source control: status, diffs, stage/unstage, commit, push/pull, recent commits | relay | The desktop's typed `git.*` bridge on the project's folder (no free-form git). On your network it goes through the relay leg next to SSH; not for the computer's SSH projects or a project with no folder, which say why |
| Inbox: approvals, questions, finished turns | ✓ | Held hook approvals are answered deterministically (never with keystrokes); a multi-select question lists its options but is answered in the session; each card shows its node's context % when known |
| Read-ack (reading a finished session clears it on the computer) | ✓ | `inbox.ack` over the relay, `~/.nodeterm/acks` over SSH |
| Usage (rate limits per account) | ✓ | From the agent-status mirror, with a pace line ("5h usage pace faster") when the reset time is known |
| All computers: every paired computer's Inbox and Usage on one screen | ✓ | With two or more computers paired: cards newest first across computers, each naming its computer and answered on it; one Usage section per computer that reports usage. Each computer's row shows how many of its approvals and questions are open, from its last listing (the list dials nothing) |

## Build

```bash
cd android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug          # → app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew -p protocol test            # the wire layer; see below
```

Needs JDK 17–24 and the Android SDK (Android Studio's, or `ANDROID_HOME`). `minSdk` 26, `targetSdk` 35.
Android Studio's bundled JDK works, and CI uses 17. JDK 25 does not: the wrapper's Gradle 8.14.3 cannot
run on it (its embedded Kotlin compiler rejects the version while compiling the build scripts, so
`./gradlew` stops before configuring anything); that needs Gradle 9.1 or newer. Point `JAVA_HOME` at a
17–24 JDK if your default is 25.
CI builds the debug APK on every change under `android/` or to the desktop code the protocol tests
run (`.github/workflows/android.yml`; its path filter says which) and attaches it to the run. The
debug APK is not minified. Only the release build type runs R8 (`app/proguard-rules.pro`), and CI
builds it too, unsigned and not published
(`./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`, then `tools/check-r8-output.sh`). A missing `-dontwarn` therefore
fails CI rather than a first release (R8 reports the missing class), and so does one of the keeps the
script checks when it stops matching (the WebView bridge, the worker, BouncyCastle's provider tables,
one exception name). A keep that NEW reflection needs is not detected, because R8 renames or drops
such code without a word; add the keep and a line in `tools/check-r8-output.sh`. None of this proves
a minified APK works on a phone; none has been run on one.

Every CI job that runs `./gradlew` first checks `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` against Gradle's
published checksums (`gradle/actions/setup-gradle`, which also caches `~/.gradle`). Dependabot opens
weekly Gradle update PRs for `android/`, the protocol build and the wrapper included (not for
`tools/typecheck`, whose pins follow the app's by hand). The protocol's network and crypto libraries
(okhttp, sshj, eddsa, BouncyCastle) come in a PR of their own, so an androidx bump the app cannot take
yet (one that demands a higher `compileSdk`, say) does not hold them back. CodeQL analyses the app's
and the protocol module's Kotlin (`.github/workflows/android.yml`, job `CodeQL (Kotlin)`) whenever
that workflow runs: on a branch push or a pull request that changes an Android-relevant file, on
`main` when such a change lands, and by hand (workflow_dispatch). A pull request that changes none is
compared with `main`'s analysis. There is no weekly re-scan of unchanged Kotlin, and the job is not a
required check. `GradleCiCoverageTest` pins all of this. The wrapper properties carry no
`distributionSha256Sum` yet, so the Gradle distribution itself is not pinned.

**Debug builds are signed with a public key that is committed on purpose**
(`app/debug.keystore`, password `android`). That is what lets you install a newer CI or local
debug APK over an older one without uninstalling — uninstalling wipes every pairing. The other side
of "public": anyone can sign an APK that installs as an update over a debug build and inherits its
data, including the keys your computers trust. **Install debug APKs only from this repository's CI
or your own build.** Release builds will need their own private key; none exists yet. Debug builds
are also debuggable, which hands the phone's pairing credentials to anyone with adb access to it
(see [Security](#security)).

## Layout

- **`protocol/`** — everything that goes on the wire, as a plain Kotlin/JVM library with no Android
  dependency, so it is tested on a JVM: NaCl box (a TweetNaCl port), the relay client, the host
  RPC vocabulary, pairing, the direct-SSH transport, and the parsers for what the computer serves.
  Its tests run the **desktop's own code** on the other end of the wire — `connectHostSession` and
  `createPairingService` through a local relay broker (`src/test/interop/host-fixture.ts`, bundled
  with the repo's esbuild and type-checked by the repo's `npm run typecheck` against the desktop
  interfaces it implements), and the SSH transport against a real SSH server and a sandboxed tmux.
  They need node and the repo's `node_modules` (esbuild, ws, tweetnacl) and skip without them; a
  desktop checkout's existing `npm install` is enough. `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, which CI runs, is only
  for a machine without the native toolchain: `npm ci` deletes `node_modules` first and the flag skips
  the node-pty patch and build, so over a working desktop checkout it leaves node-pty unpatched (on
  Linux, where node-pty ships no prebuild, not built at all) and `src/main/node-pty-patch.test.ts` red
  until you run `npm install` or `npm run rebuild` again (`bootstrap-windows.bat` on Windows). The
  SSH tests need tmux and `script(1)` (util-linux on Linux, BSD on macOS) and skip without them.
- **`app/`** — the Compose UI on top: pairing, the computers list (each with its needs-you count),
  a computer's Sessions / Board / Inbox / Usage tabs, the All computers screen (every computer's
  Inbox and Usage), the terminal screen, a project's source control, settings, background
  notifications.

## Notifications

The background check never makes a first relay connection (that would put the approval dialog on
an unattended computer): it uses the relay only for a computer that has already approved this
phone. After Deny, or an approval nobody answered, the app stops re-dialing the relay until you tap
Try again or open that computer.


The iOS app is woken by APNs pushes the nodeterm backend sends. That backend has no Android (FCM)
leg, so this app polls instead: checked about every 15 minutes in the background (WorkManager's
floor), and live for the computer whose screen is open, which the app re-lists every 8 seconds.
Other paired computers are not polled while you look at one, so their notifications still come from
the background check only. That includes a computer you just left: the app may still hold its
connection for a while, but no longer re-lists it when it pushes a change. The All computers screen
is not polled either: it re-lists every computer once when you open it, and again on Refresh.
Real-time push on Android needs an FCM leg in the backend.

The live check leaves out what you are looking at: nothing of a computer is announced while its
Inbox tab (or the All computers Inbox) is on screen, and nothing a session's terminal shows while it
is attached. Those events count as seen, so no later check announces them either. An approval the
computer is holding for an answer (a hook-reply approval) is still announced with its terminal open,
because Claude paints that prompt only once the hold ends. A terminal that shows an error, a relay
offer or an approval code instead of the session hides nothing, and one still connecting leaves the
session's events for the next check.

Tapping a notification opens that session's terminal; Back from it lands on the computer's Inbox. An
approval's notification carries **Approve** and **Deny**, and a question's carries its options when it
has at most three ("Option 1", "Option 2", …, or their text with **Show details in notifications**
on), wherever the Inbox card could answer it in one tap: a held Claude approval or a Claude prompt, a
single-select question. Anything else carries **Open**. An answer needs an unlocked phone (Android 12
and later ask for the unlock; on older versions the notification says to unlock first). It goes over
your network or through a relay that has already approved this phone, never through a first relay
connection, for the same reason as the background check, and otherwise the notification offers Open.
The notification then says how it went ("Approved.", "Already handled.", or why nothing was sent, with
a tap that opens the session), and an answer is never sent twice.

Each Inbox event raises at most one notification: only events younger than 6 hours are announced,
and the phone remembers the ones it has announced, you have read or you had on screen for a day
after it last saw them (longer when the computer's clock runs ahead), so nothing still eligible is
forgotten.

A notification names the session, the computer and the kind of event ("Needs you — build-bot",
"Needs approval"), but not the event's own text: the command, file or question, or the agent's last
message. Android shows a notification's full content on a secure lock screen unless you hide
sensitive content there. **Settings → Show details in notifications** (off by default) adds that
text. A lock screen set to hide sensitive content shows only the title ("Needs you — <session>", or
"Completed — <session>" for a finished or interrupted turn) and the computer's name either way. The
iOS app does receive the detail, in the push the desktop sends.

## Security

- The phone's relay identity (a Curve25519 box key) and SSH identity (an Ed25519 seed) are
  generated on the device and stored encrypted under an Android Keystore AES-GCM key. Only their
  public halves are ever sent anywhere; the next point is how the private halves can still be taken.
- **The debug APK is debuggable, and it is the only build there is.** AGP marks every debug build
  `android:debuggable`, so anyone with adb access to your unlocked phone while USB debugging is on
  (from a computer the phone has authorized, or by accepting the prompt on it) can read the app's
  files with `adb shell run-as dev.nodeterm.android` and attach a debugger to the running app. The
  Keystore never hands out the key those files are sealed under, but it lets any code running as the
  app use it, so that is enough to pull the phone's pairing credentials: the SSH private key your computers
  accept, the relay box secret and the relay device token. A signed, non-debuggable release build does
  not exist yet. Until it does, keep USB and wireless debugging off when you are not using them.
- **If someone else may have had adb access, pairing again is not enough.** The phone keeps its SSH
  key, its relay box key and its relay device id through a re-pair, so each computer would trust the
  same keys again. Give the phone a new identity before it pairs:
  1. Revoke every entry for this phone on each computer (nodeterm → Settings → Phone → Revoke).
  2. Uninstall the app, or clear its storage (Android Settings → Apps → nodeterm → Storage → Clear
     storage; the names vary by phone). Either one deletes the app's stored keys and every pairing,
     and the app then makes a new SSH key, relay box key and relay device id.
  3. Pair each computer again.

  A computer without Pro cannot revoke the old relay device token at the relay (that request is
  signed with the Pro entitlement), so whoever took it may still reach that computer through the
  relay with the old box key. The revoke unpinned that key, so the computer shows its approval dialog
  with a code before it lets it in: approve a phone there only while your own phone is showing the
  same code.
- Nothing of the app's goes into a backup or a phone-to-phone transfer. `allowBackup="false"` stops
  cloud backup, and the manifest's data extraction rules stop the Android 12+ device-to-device
  transfer, which ignores `allowBackup`. A new phone starts unpaired; pair it again.
- The relay device id goes with the relay key: from this build on, if the key ever has to be
  created again (it was lost), a new device id is minted with it, so the phone does not present an
  old device id with a new key. A phone whose key an older build already replaced keeps its device
  id until the app is reinstalled.
- Relay traffic is end-to-end encrypted (NaCl box under a per-session HKDF key) and checked exactly
  as the desktop checks it: role byte (no reflections), strictly increasing sequence numbers (no
  replays), no re-key once ready, and the host key pinned from pairing.
- The SSH host key is pinned on the first connect that authenticates (a server that refuses the
  phone's key is never pinned). A changed key is never used over SSH; in Auto the phone goes on to
  the relay, which verifies the computer separately, and shows a warning.
- No cleartext HTTP anywhere; the LAN `/pair` POST runs over a raw socket and is sealed to the host
  key from the QR. Its answer is read as untrusted: at most 64 KiB, within 45 seconds.
